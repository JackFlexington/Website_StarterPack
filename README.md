# Project: Website_StarterPack

## Overview
Cloning this repository will instantly give you a workable directory for developing front-end web skills
HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript are the main components to this whole operation.
  * You can think of HTML5 like the "bricks" and "architectural framework" of a building.
    * Using HTML elements you can design components that display on the web page.
    * Built-in animation features
  * CSS3 allows you to modify, alter, re-arrange HTML5 elements.
    * Modify backgrounds, alter element sizes, handles animation styling.
  * Javascript can also manipulate the HTML5 components (referred to as "DOM" in the Javascript communtity)
    * Unfornuately the amount of things you can do with Javascript are just to vast to be covered in this guide. However, there is hope yet... 
    * [Mozilla Firefox -- Javascript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)... aka, the holy grail of Javascript understanding. You can reference this website to stay current in the Javascript communtity.
